Consuming API endpoint with .NET/C#

### Final Takeaways:  

I just wanted to test out implementing an API endpoint consumption in C# to learn the ins and outs of a different language.  I mostly followed the microsoft documentation, and now I really want to learn more C#!  I wasn't sure what to add to the .gitignore, so I downloaded a template online to prevent bloat.  That being said, I bet there's still some things I should have added to it!
